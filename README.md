Wumpus World Agent:

In this project, we have been asked to create a logical agent for the Wumpus game. The goal of the agent is to kill the Wumpus in its corresponding room and find the hidden gold before moving to its room. The Agent was coded in prolog, where we created certain rules in the knowledge base, so that, the agent can reference the optimal path in the future and succeed in avoiding a failure.

This project was coded by Ahmed AL Hilal and Yasmine Najd.
